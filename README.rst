Autotodo.txt
############

Autotodotxt will be a set of scripts to automatically manage a todo.txt file. Put 
it in the operating systems autorun framework and then every day you will be 
met by a fresh todo.txt file. With fresh I mean that:

1. Complete items have been moved to a todo-done.txt file.
2. Future item that cannot be started yet have have been moved to a separate file.
3. Future items that are now current are moved into the todo file again.
4. Recurring items are handled in a similar way.

The syntax of the todo.txt, and infact the whole concept is based on the
